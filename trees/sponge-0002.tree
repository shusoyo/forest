\strong{Target 1: Webget}

\p{
  To implement a byte stream based on the reliable transmission interface (TCP socket protocol) provided by the system.
}

\strong{Target 2: In Memory Byte Stream}

\p{
  The peek function interface only gets the next byte of size 1 rather than specifing the length, so we can use queue to do this. In this way, the ByteStream throughput is only 0.70 Gbit/s.
